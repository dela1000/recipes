I was all over those cans of Cream of Mushroom soup like white on rice… I’m a little embarrassed about it now.  Anyways, I still love my Crock Pot, I’m just a bit more selective about what I toss in it. One of my favorite pre-Paleo recipes is still a go-to slow cooker pick these days.  It’s based on this great recipe from Dishing With Leslie called Balsamic Chicken. It’s very popular on the internet and many people have tried to take credit for it… which sucks. I made it according to her directions and honestly found it a touch bland.  So here’s my version, full of flavor and 100% Paleo friendly.  If you need to feed a crowd or are looking for great leftovers, look no further. Prepare for Paleo Crock Pot deliciousness at its best… and its slowest.',
